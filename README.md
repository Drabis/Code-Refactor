 
 This project, we aim to improve the database by reorganizing the layout and make it more concise and focus. The main objective in this assignment is to make the website more accessible to the search engine and facilitate the use for people with disability. A business with an easy access webpage is always is a big plus for the productivity because it help go grow their customers following.
For this purpose I have made a clear semantic of my code in three parts with the Header, Main attached with sections and aside.
In the CSS style I also clear some unnecessary class to make it easy to ready and modify. The structure will allow more visibility to the search engine.
